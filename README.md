# APIs

## Auth0

Auth0 provides authentication and authorization as a service, You can connect any application (written in any language or on any stack) to Auth0 and define the identity providers you want to use (how you want your users to log in). hook it up to your app. Now each time a user tries to authenticate, Auth0 will verify their identity and send the required information back to your app.

## Stripe & Stripe-Connect

Stripe is a technology company based in San Francisco, California. Its software allows individuals and businesses to make and receive payments over the Internet. Stripe provides the technical, fraud prevention, and banking infrastructure required to operate online payment systems.

## Cloudinary

 Cloudinary provides a cloud-based image and video management solution. It enables users to upload, store manage, manipulate and deliver images and video for websites and apps
